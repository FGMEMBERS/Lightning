Some details gathered from all over the place,
not necessarily F.1A related

Lots of Lightning tales (flying, working on) at 
http://www.lightning.org.uk/archive/index.php
especially this one:

There are a considerable number of British Pathe reels
of interest, showing Lightnings from the prototypes to
the F6s in flight, even in-cockpit shots.
