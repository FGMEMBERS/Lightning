      March, 2004

Flight Lieutenant Ian Black, the last Royal Air Force pilot to pass
through the Lightning Training Course at Binbrook, tells the story of
his transition onto type and his experience flying the finest single
seat jet ever produced in the UK. It was first published in Warbirds
Worldwide - Jets (Midland Counties Publications).


      THE LAST OF THE LIGHTNING PILOTS

Some years ago, the choices for a trainee pilot, having completed the
Attack and Weapons training course on Hawks at RAF Brawdy and having
been assessed for suitability for a high workload environment (possibly
single-seat), were either single-seat air defence or F-4 Phantom or, in
the ground attack role, Tornado, Buccaneer (Maritime), Harrier or
Jaguar. Each aircraft had its benefits, but for me there was only one
choice - the Lightning, possibly the meanest aircraft ever to leave a
British factory.

Having grown up around the Lightning, it was a dream of mine to fly in
an aircraft but only a fantasy to pilot one. Everything about the
Lightning captured me - I had to fly it. Posting time came and it was
with more than a little trepidation that I downed my pint pot, to read
the word 'Lightning' stuck to the bottom! The dream had started.
Attending the mandatory pre-OCU (Operational Conversion Unit) course, my
compatriot and I were told how very lucky we were to be on the last LTF
Course (Lightning Training Flight) and how many had passed before us.

Driving up the hill to RAF Binbrook brought back many childhood memories
- the snow, howling gales and frequent rain, not to mention fog. Soon it
was to become a way of life again. As a boy, I used to gaze at the
runway with my elder brother, watching 5 Squadron aircraft take-off and
landing and rushing off to intercept the resident Canberra and Meteor
aircraft of 85 Squadron. How odd it was to be back, twenty years later,
standing amongst enthusiasts and knowing that soon I would be on the
other side of the fence getting to grips with the Ferrari of fighter
aircraft.

If you ever went into the LTF crewroom at Binbrook you will have surely
seen one of the most incredible pieces of post-war wall art of an early
flying machine covering an entire wall, complete with all the Lightning
foibles and faults; a fascinating painting. You could only feel more
than a little humble entering the coffee bar, thinking you were once
King of the Skies having completed the Hawk weapons course at Brawdy, to
be surrounded by seven or eight Lightning instructors all wearing 1000
hour badges, many of them who were Intercept Weapons Instructors,
Qualified Flying Instructors or merely Tactics Instructors. The flying
side of the Royal Air Force is one of lifes great levellers!

Coffee over, it was time to go outside for a course photograph in front
of the LTF Flagship, a high fatigue Mk.6 aircraft with a fuel pack
fitted instead of the usual guns to give it an increased endurance as an
airborne target for the unit's T.5 and F.3 aircraft. After a very
civilised week's ground school, it was into the simulator for a further
week's emergency training. Luckily, the use of the four inch torture
tube (in the right hand corner, called the radar) was to come later. At
the end of a week's basic simulator flying, it gave me a fair idea that
the next six months was not going to be easy.

Ground school over, it was up to the LTF to begin the CONVEX (Conversion
Exercises) phase. This normally comprised five dual sorties, then a solo
sortie, then a mixture of random dual and solo sorties alternating in
the T.5 and F.3. The T.5 had an awkward cockpit, both in terms of size
and instrumentation layout, with all the main flight instruments grouped
in the centre of the cockpit. This gave an instant parallax problem with
the side by side seating.

The first impression of the T.5, and somewhat off-putting, was its
enormous size, like a giant feline beast waiting to pounce. This
aircraft was a good deal bigger than the tiny Hawk I'd been used to some
two weeks previously. The cockpit was some ten feet off the ground and
access could only be gained by using the awkward ladder strung
underneath the in-flight refuelling probe. You had to be a small
contortionist to climb the ladder, in full flying kit, whilst going
under and over the probe to gain access to the cockpit. At first,
strapping in was also laborious, coming from the Hawk which had a simple
lap and shoulder restraint system; the Lightning had a far more complex
and ancient system of straps, buckles and quick-release boxes. Prior to
each sortie the engineering F700 (Form 700) was always checked in the
engineering line hut. The '700 was basically like a car service schedule
showing any minor faults or major faults which required rectification on
the aircraft.

Arriving at the Lightning, the customary pilot 'walk round' would be
carried out before each sortie. Starting on the left hand side with the
nose wheel-well, a quick check of the nose-wheel doors to ensure they
would move freely and onto the radome area. A cursory check of the
radome to ensure that the bullet wasn't burnt and that nobody had thrown
any object down the intake which would cause foreign object damage
(FOD). Around to the right-hand side of the fuselage and it was time to
check for any fuel leaks. Lightnings often leaked like sieves, but as
long as they leaked in the right place you were normally happy to take
them. A good idea now was to check the tyres, especially on a windy day
when tyres could get burnt out in one sortie, so well worn tyres were
not normally accepted. Around the back of the aircraft and a check of
the accumulator pressure gauges and quick look down the jet pipe to look
for any molten metal - a sure sign of turbine blade failure. A similar
glance across the left hand side of the aircraft and it was time to
climb the ladder and get strapped in.

Having strapped in and turned the main aircraft battery ON, you could
adjust the ejector seat height. This would also give you an indication
of whether the voltage on the battery was good. Time to give the ground
crew the signal to connect external power using AC and DC voltage. A
quick look around the cockpit from left to right to ensure that nothing
is missing and back to the throttle box to check full and free movement.
As part of the engine start, it was now vital to signal to the
groundcrew that you wished to start the No.1 engine. At engine start,
hot exhaust gasses are expelled from underneath the aircraft, and anyone
standing nearby could be badly burned. He returns your 'wind up' signal
and you open the throttle, allowing the HP cock to open. Pulling the
rapid start gang bar up with the LP cocks ON and selecting the start ice
light switch to START, you press the Start button for two seconds.
Instantly, a loud hissing explosion occurs behind you as half a gallon
of AVPIN (isopropyl nitrate) ignites inside its combustion chamber,
turning the Avon engine into life.

A careful watch of the RPM gauge and the temperature gauge show you how
the start is going. On a hot day with a tail wind, the engine will reach
800° Centigrade in two or three seconds. With No.1 engine running, you
can either use external power or disconnect it and bring the aircraft's
own power on line to start No.2 engine. Quite often the aircraft will be
temperamental during start, particularly in the rain or damp. On winter
days at Binbrook it wasn't uncommon to see three or four ground crew
climbing onto Lightning spines and hitting them furiously with hammers
in an effort to help them start!

With both engines running, relatively few checks were required prior to
taxy. Checking that the ejector seat pins were out and your elbows were
in, it was time to close the canopy. Any previous thoughts you had about
the cramped cockpit were now confirmed. Once the hood was down you felt
like a mouse in a cage, surrounded by ironwork and with small windows to
view through. A final check of the brake pressure and a quick flick of
the taxy light on to show you were ready to move; parking brake OFF and
she quickly pounces forward.

Squeeze the brake and the tub nods down showing that both brakes are
working well. A small kick of the right foot and a small squeeze on the
stick mounted brake handle and the aircraft turns right with plenty of
excess power to taxy, even at idle thrust. Taxying a large aircraft like
the Lightning using the stick mounted brake lever and differential
brakes was a bit tricky at first but became natural with time. Keeping
the head moving whilst taxying out to avoid hitting other aircraft, you
run through the pre take-off checks, basically to ensure you are going
to get the aircraft airborne safely. If all else failed, four major
checks could often save the day: CONTROLS, that they were full and free;
CAPTIONS, that they were all out; PINS, that you had four stowed and the
seat was live and the CANOPY was down and locked.

Lining up on the centre of the runway is not as easy as it looks. With
those ultra-thin high-pressure tyres, the Lightning would skid and slide
very easily on wet concrete, especially on the painted 'piano keys'.
With clearance to take off and a final check of controls, canopy and
captions, you apply the brakes and advance the throttles to FULL,
checking that the RPM and the JPT (Jet Pipe Temperature) rise in the
correct sense. With brakes holding at 92%, a quick check around the
cockpit to ensure everything is in order, you release the brakes and
slam the throttles forward. RPM up to 104%, JPT below 795°C and checking
the nozzle position, you have already reached 100 knots by the RHAG
(Rotary Hydraulic Arrester Gear) cable.

Checking the main and stand-by airspeed indicators agree, you soon find
you are at 135 knots. Stick back, and the nose-wheel comes off, taking
care not to scrape the tail as you do this. 155 knots, and a small
rearward check on the stick gets you airborne. Even with the enormous
thrust available on the T.5, the aircraft still felt heavy with a
cold-power take-off. A burner take-off in a T.5 is another story!

Airborne with a positive rate of climb, the undercarriage is selected
UP, checking the lights went from three greens to three reds and then
out. This told you that the doors were clear and locked. On your first
sortie at this stage, your brain is still telling you you are still in
the crew room as she has already accelerated up to 450 knots, the
Lightning climb speed. You instantly realise that with the nose about
101 to 151 above the horizon even in cold power that the aircraft is
motoring. The standard climb out of Binbrook on runway 21 was a left
hand turn onto a heading of 040° through the Blueway (airway Blue One)
up to the normal level of FL250 (25,000 feet). You would normally be at
this level by Spurn Point, just 15 miles North East of the airfield.
Once you realise where you are, it is time to level off. The first thing
you need to do is take a fuel check. Already the small underbelly tank
is almost empty, leaving only wing and flap fuel to complete the sortie.
On this initial sortie, just a few turns are performed to see how the
Lightning handles, how much buffet is used and how docile the aircraft
is at low speeds.

Now it is time to run through a simulated down-wind circuit leg at
height, to give you an idea of what was to come. Speed reducing at back
below 250 knots, undercarriage coming down, fuel sufficient for
recovery, flaps travelling, harness tight and locked, checking you have
three greens and that the toggle was engaged, ie. that the undercarriage
was locked down. Tipping into a final turn at approximately 200 knots on
an imaginary runway, the Lightning required a bit of pull and a bit of
rudder to get it going around the corner.

Heads back in again now and on to instruments for an IF type turn.
Holding at 190 knots, easy with the excess power and looking to roll out
on finals with 175 to 170 knots. Watching your aiming point and holding
the threshold in the middle of the windscreen. Popping the airbrakes out
to allow you to have a higher power setting than required, so that if
you had to abort or land short, a quick blip on the airbrakes would
retract them and give you extra instant thrust. Still holding your
imaginary runway on the nose and then watching the speed as the height
reduces quickly, small adjustments in the power peg the speed at 170
knots and you cross the threshold, looking for 165 knots on touchdown.

Climbing away, putting the gear and flaps up and popping the airbrakes
in it is time to recover now for a PAR (Precision Approach Radar). This
allowed you more time to think what was going on rather than attempting
a visual 'run-and-break' during your first sortie. Setting up for the
descent, throttles at idle/idle, and looking to be about 15 miles on the
runway centreline at 2000 feet with the gears and the flap down. Heads
in now and on to instruments, it was quickly apparent that the aircraft
was not speed-stable, ie. you constantly had to be aware of what the
speed was doing and making small power adjustments. It was not possible,
as in more modern aircraft, to set an RPM and peg a speed, and you
constantly had to move the throttles to maintain the required speed.

Trying to pick up the scan rate between speed heading and height whilst
listening to all the air traffic instructions certainly concentrated the
mind. Maintaining your head in the cockpit, you look up at 400 feet and
decide to overshoot to join the visual circuit. Unlike most fighter
aircraft, you apply full power, select the airbrakes in and leave the
undercarriage and flap down to minimise fatigue. At 500 feet midway down
the runway you start a gentle 60° bank turn to put yourself down-wind at
a thousand feet and 200 knots with the downwind checks complete.

On a right hand circuit, sitting in the left hand seat you were now
blind to the runway, which lay on your right hand side. Now it was a
case of instrument flying, holding the height on the altimeter and
maintaining your runway heading, allowing for wind. Setting yourself up
at the finals turnpoint, rolling in at 200-190 knots, kicking in a small
amount of rudder and pulling back on the stick to keep the aeroplane
going around the turn, the feature of a swept wing fighter. Half way
round finals you pop the airbrakes to allow you to set a higher power
setting than required, to give you the previously mentioned power to get
you out of trouble if required. Getting onto the centre-line, your
finger is constantly trimming back to give the aircraft its
characteristic stalky nose-up appearance on finals.

Things are happening very fast now as you reduce the speed to 175 knots,
looking to cross the fence at 165 knots and touch down on the numbers
(and no-where else!) at 160 knots. A final check of your gear and flap
as you now divide your attention between speed and runway. Is the
threshold moving up in the windscreen? If so, you are not on a collision
with the threshold and something has changed. Just as you feel you are
about six inches off the deck, it's airbrakes IN, power UP and you
overshoot. We rarely tried rolls; this saved tyre life and aircraft fatigue.

Climbing away, it's straight into another circuit. It could be a
flapless circuit, adding ten knots to all the speeds and taking care to
avoid a tail scrape with the higher nose attitude, or maybe a simulated
single engine circuit, again no problem due to the enormous surplus
thrust you have available with the Avon engines. Alternatively, you
could undertake a low-level circuit at 500 feet as opposed to 1000 feet.
Final landing, and you call 'precautionary' to air traffic to let them
know that should you lose your 'chute you will be staying on the deck
due to the fuel remaining, ie. that you haven't enough fuel to do
another circuit.

Round finals again, you make doubly sure your touch-down point is in the
numbers exactly the same as before, pegging the speed between 165 and
160 knots. If you landed past the numbers at 180 knots, you stood a good
chance of entering the barrier due to the Lightning's poor brakes. The
T.5 had no arrestor hook in case you had to use the over-run cable. Over
the fence, and a small check back on the stick to plant her firmly on
the concrete, pulling the 'chute handle and retarding both throttles to
idle whilst squeezing the brakes all at once; similar, I imagine, to a
carrier-deck landing in an F-4. Night landing in poor weather is a story
in itself. Popping the 'chute killed about 10-15 knots immediately. The
main difficulty came in high crosswinds on a wet runway, where the slab
sided fuselage and the high tail and thin tyres made the aircraft a real
handful. Pilots would frequently appear in the crew room ashen-faced
after a wet, windy night landing! Some pilots would tell of their
experiences of having both hands on the stick, smashing the rudder from
side to side just to keep their aircraft straight on the runway.

Back to the LTF; average sortie time for the T.5 was between 30 and 35
minutes, and it normally required five of these sorties prior to your
first solo in an F.3. This could often take some time, as you had to
have flown the T.5 on the same day in suitable weather conditions with a
minimal cloud base and good visibility and as low a cross wind as
possible. Without stating the obvious, it was a real shock to find
yourself on your own, with no one to give you that last bit of advice
for the landing, remind you to check fuel or assist you if you had an
emergency.

As you taxy out, you go through your pre take-off checks several times
just to reassure yourself that all was well. Lined up on the threshold,
you glanced back over either shoulder and you can see very little, only
the in-flight refuelling probe on your left hand side and the highly
swept wings. Once you are airborne in a single seater, there is only one
person that can land the beast - and that is YOU! As it transpires, the
landing is not too bad, as you have just had a consolidated effort in
the two-seater, building up on your circuits. The tricky part comes in
the radar phase, when your mind is still full of figures, heights and
headings from the last intercept. Then comes the difficult part; trying
to land the aircraft with all that information in your head.

The CONVEX part of the LTF course was about 25 to 30 sorties - five to
go solo, after which max rate turning, supersonic performance, a large
bout of instrument flying culminating in a IRT (Instrument Rating Test)
giving you a 'white' rating using a decision height of 400 feet, then
close formation (which was a delight), battle, low-level, and then
tail-chasing. Finally, a few more general handling trips and then a
final handling test. This really covered everything learned so far with
some sort of simulated emergency near the end of the sortie, which
required a diversion to a local airfield. Having passed your final
handling test, it was back to ground school for a week's lectures prior
to the radar phase.

Prior to any of the radar sorties, lengthy briefings were given on the
weapons system - either Red Top or Firestreak (the gun was left to
individual squadrons, however, as no LTF aircraft carried them).
Additionally, many hours were devoted to basic radar theory, intercept
technique and aircraft performance. As much use of the simulator was
made as possible, with each sortie flown in the simulator prior to being
flown in the air. Initial radar sorties were very basic, with no target
evasion and known target heading with targets above the fighter at
pre-set speeds. However, within six months the pilot would be expected
to deal with any evasion in heading, height or speed. Early sorties
provided an extremely high workload; attempting to fly the aircraft
whilst having your head stuck in the radar tube and managing the weapons
system and the fuel system required a new and unfound skill. To achieve
a simulated weapons kill on radar was no mean feat. However, visual
identification on radar was an even harder skill.

The Lightning's main task during peacetime was to identify targets
unknown, day or night, 365 days a year. The vis-ident procedure involved
closing on a target to about a mile (on radar again) and then gently
easing in to 300 yards, again on radar, simulating in cloud or at night
to pick up a target visually to join in close formation on him - no mean
feat on a single-seat aircraft.

Towards the middle of the radar phase on the LTF, a night dual sortie
was followed by a night solo - this being introduced to give a taste of
squadron operation. With about 30 radar sorties (approximately 20 hours
completed) the fun part of the course began with low-level evasion
training and like ACT, ie. Lightning v Lightning Air Combat Training.
Having come from the Hawk, the major plus of the Lightning at low level
was its enormous thrust, something it had a staggering amount of. It was
all too easy to go supersonic at low level, and a constant eye had to be
kept on speed, fuel and position. Fighting the aeroplane at low level
overland was back to the Fifties, folding the radar 'boot' away and
reverting to the Mark One eyeball to detect hostile targets.

Once a hostile target was sighted, the Lightning was pure fun to fly and
fight. If a target was sighted at long range, a small nudge on the
throttles would quickly give you a mass of overtake and bring you into
missile range in seconds. A late pick-up meant converting excess speed
to angles; this was done either pulling to the G limit or, weather
permitting, reefing the aircraft into the vertical to convert speed to
height and thus allow better turn-rate from low speed at height. Most
squadron pilots attempted to use only 'cold' power at low level. This
had a twofold bonus; it kept down the noise and reduced fuel
consumption. In addition to low-level evasion training over land,
similar training over the sea was also carried out on the LTF. This
would be most useful for the squadron work-up, where most intercepts
were carried out over the North Sea.

If the weather was unsuitable for low-level flying, the course would
switch into air combat mode, with students using a safety height of
10,000 feet as a base. If pilots new to the Lightning were surprised by
the low level fuel consumption, air combat took the biscuit. In full
reheat, sortie times in an F.3 from take-off to landing could often be
as low a ten minutes. Having had your appetite whetted for most types of
Lightning flying, the course culminated in an OPEVAL - an operational
evaluation of your ability, whereby any aspect of the previous month's
flying could be tested in a single sortie. A typical sortie could entail
a high level intercept to a visual identification, descent to low-level
for another radar intercept, followed by close formation recovery
through cloud for a pairs landing, all with only 40 hours on type!

Having passed the OCU and feeling almost like a fighter pilot, you
quickly realise there is still a long way to go. Electronic Counter
Measures (ECM), night Practice Intercepts (PIs), air to air refuelling
by day and by night and air-to-air gunnery, missile practice camps and
'Saturn' PIs, attacks from 250 feet to 55,000 feet at any height,
heading or speed. I often reflected after several sorties that I had
just flown one of the world's greatest fighters. Admittedly it had no
amazing radar and no radar missiles, but on a clear day it's still a
classic fighter, and now a real warbird. I often wondered in 1988, as I
thought the Lightning was so good, what it was like to fly it in 1958!
Hopefully, it won't be long before we see a Lightning in the air again.

Operators of Lightnings on the Civil Register are going to have their
own small problems. Admittedly they won't be related to the weapons or
radar systems, as these can be deleted. Obviously operating a Lightning
won't be cheap, but neither is rebuilding a Lancaster from scratch, so
it can be done. One of the critical factors of operating a Lightning
will undoubtedly be the engineering set-up. Specialist tools will be
needed for engine changes, removal of jet pipes and any major work on
the aircraft's antiquated electrical system. Before any safety-conscious
pilot would ever climb into a Lightning, the ejector seats will have to
be in tip-top condition, undergoing regular servicing by qualified
Martin-Baker personnel. This I believe could cost up to £25,000 per
seat. Lightning mainwheel tyres fit no other aircraft, and even have to
be specially built for each aircraft, though I gather sufficient
supplies remain in stock.

Almost unique to the Lightning (although the Canberra PR.9 and the Saab
Drakens operating in Denmark also use it) is the highly volatile AVPIN
starter fluid. For this you would need an explosives licence to house
it. Again, only a small quantity of this fluid is manufactured per month
and figures of around £40 per gallon have been quoted. Six gallons are
used for two starts of the engines. Most important of all would be to
remain current on the aircraft, ie. flying at least 20 to 30 hours per
summer season if any sort of safe display was to be performed. However,
with a little will-power and enough determination I am sure these
problems can be overcome. I feel that realistically the two-seat variant
of the aircraft will be the most economical to fly. Other major factors
affecting a decision as the whether a flying licence could be granted
for the Lightning would be the length of the runway it was to be
operated from. 6,000 feet will be the absolute minimum you could use to
operate the aircraft safely. Whether or not I would like to fly a
civilian Lightning remains another story, but should one appear at an
airshow, I'd be the first to go and see it!
